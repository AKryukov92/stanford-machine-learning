Here is another test case that is a robust because the X matrix is not square and theta has no zero values.

The thread is closed to comments. If you have a question, please post in a new thread, and include a copy of this test case and your results.

X = [ones(3,1) magic(3)];
y = [1 0 1]';
theta = [-2 -1 1 2]';

% un-regularized
[j g] = costFunction(theta, X, y)
% or...
[j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 0)

% results
j = 4.6832

g =
  0.31722
  0.87232
  1.64812
  2.23787

% regularized
[j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 3)
% note: also works for ex3 lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, 3)

% results
j = 7.6832

g =
  0.31722
  -0.12768
  2.64812
  4.23787
